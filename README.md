## Getting_Started

### Importance of Health

<p align="center">
<img width="500" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82595288/228840596-f94e6248-8d52-4a7d-a6ac-16b23566fcac.png">  

***`Don't give up! We're always by your side.`***
  Health refers to a state in which the body and mind are functioning well without any pain or discomfort. It signifies complete functioning and well-being in terms of an individual's ***physiological***, ***psychological***, and ***social aspects***. Health is associated with vitality, energy, and quality of life that we experience on a daily basis.

Plogging is a combination of Jogging with picking up litter merging the Swedish verbs ***plocka*** upp (pick up) and ***jogga***(jog) gives the new Swedish verb ***plogga***.
The key to plogging is not just the concept of environmental protection of picking up trash, but approaching picking up trash as one of the health-training exercises. The advantage is that it consumes more physical strength than general jogging. While jogging normally with a garbage bag, if you encounter illegally dumped garbage, pick it up and put it in a garbage bag.
In fact, according to a survey by Swedish fitness app Life Island, people who jog only for 30 minutes consume an average of 235kcal, but those who plogging at the same time consume 288kcal. In other words, it doubles the effectiveness of exercise.

## What is Sustainable Development Goals?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33146152/160327143-e36bb1b9-ccea-4f96-b3b2-d92338dd56c5.png)

The Sustainable Development Goals (SGDs) or Global Goals are a collection of 17 interlinked global goals designed to be a "blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all.
As can be seen in the figure above, there are 17 goals.

### Our goal

We selected several of the UN's 17 sustainable development goals to create an flutter application. And we found activities that can take care of my health and help the environment. After that, we found the actrivity "plogging", and we thought it would be nice if we could add additional features to draw interest from users.

#### Good Health and Well-Being

<img width="143" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33146152/160327288-21a43bdc-3de2-4d36-a26e-9953dc86bc4f.png">
Plogging is an activity to pick up trash while running. App users can improve their health while using this application. Also they can do "well-being" by sharing their progress with people around the world and friends.

#### Responsible consumption and production

<img width="146" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33146152/160338918-1069a764-d3ce-43cb-ae23-2f597ae0d161.png">
As mentioned above, the positive aspects of the environment and sustainable consumption can ve derived through the action of picking up recycled waste.

### The reason why we named "Isak"

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33146152/160325415-8deaab92-23fd-44fe-aa66-74c3d70f5181.png)

During the plogging process, you naturally bend your back. So we thought this posture was very similar to the prople from one of the famous paintings, "The Gleaners".
In Korean, "the Gleaners" sounds like "Isak". Therefore, our team decided the logo and application name in this way.

</p>
If you want to take a break from jogging, the app asks you if you want to do plogging. When you start plogging, the app automatically displays the route line in green and plogging starts. At this time, distance, time, and pace are not measured.

```
That's it! Let's go plogging!

## Trash Classification and Object Detection

### Classification Model

<p align="center">
<img width="400" alt="assets_ml_-MMARWLU6xXHUlsfby29_-MMAYgUCxGtR2ImywRm3__2020-07-20__9 07 42" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87767242/161139376-4ebc7db6-57b0-4ea4-be68-46678d32f19d.png">

We discussed a lightweight deep learning model that can be driven on mobile through meetings and chose a model called MobileNetV3. Transfer learning was conducted through the data ([here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jinfree/recycle-classification-dataset)), and this resulted in satisfactory accuracy.  

<p align="center">
<img width="1000" alt="assets_ml_-MMARWLU6xXHUlsfby29_-MMAYgUCxGtR2ImywRm3__2020-07-20__9 07 42" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87767242/161139901-6380cd0b-4315-4bc9-9d27-3b61b131d6f9.png">
<img width="500" alt="assets_ml_-MMARWLU6xXHUlsfby29_-MMAYgUCxGtR2ImywRm3__2020-07-20__9 07 42" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87767242/161139890-e477e21f-8102-4259-8ec6-af04e61bf788.png">
</p>

When I tested the actual product with a test case, I was satisfied with the results.

### Mobile Testing

#### Success to Plogging

 <p align="center">
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87767242/161146355-f072d75d-0bae-471e-9ac7-1fd132c3b571.gif" alt="text" width="400"  />
</p>

#### Faild to Plogging

<p align="center">
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87767242/161144670-9d349d2c-b398-489e-8f3a-25d08c88e0bb.gif" alt="text" width="400"  />
</p>

After converting the model into a tflite file, the model was transplanted into a mobile and tested. During plogging state, you can take a picture of the trash you picked up. Models learned with tensorflow automatically recognize garbage and automatically calssify which garbage user picked up. Then, the place where the garbage was picked up is marked with purple dots. The more trash you pick up and shoot, the more plogging points you'll get.

```
the application will take care of what you picked up
```

## Trash Object Detection ( New Feature )
#### Preview
The previous model was not the one we finally wanted. It was a model that classified only four things and could not be processed in real time. However, after mentoring at this gdsc, we were finally able to implement the method we wanted.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87767242/172432196-fbbd64a9-20c5-42cd-aa6d-40e24e334c30.gif" alt="text" width="400"  />
</p>
Real-time object detection and image labeling functions are used to implement more effective plogging. It recognizes several objects as shown, and among them, it is possible to be plogging the target red rectangle. The implementation of this used object detection among ML kits supported by Google, and this function was recommended to us by a mentor during gdsc mentoring. It was easy to use these features during the few remaining deadlines, and the results were successful.

#### Doing Plogging
<p align="center">
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87767242/172425780-cfa7ec25-ee23-4677-9a5d-37f9fa07c960.gif" alt="text" width="400"  />

</p>

After taking a picture of trash, it automatically recognizes and sorts trash so that user can see at a glance what kind of garbage user picked up. 

## Finish

</p>

If you stop plogging and jogging is over, you can take pictures of the surrounding landscape, and if you press finish, your records are saved on the server. If you press the share button on the right, you can immediately write down your own post in the community.

You can donate with points collected through plogging activities. If this app is supported by the government or city, we think it will be able to support more disadvantaged neighbors. Wouldn't it be proud if you donated the points you've worked hard for running and blogging to neighbors in need? Currently, donations can be made to large-scale volunteer organizations such as UNICEF and save-the-childeren.

## Map cluster

Map clustering makes it easier to see where garbage is concentrated visually, and we want to take action on where garbage is concentrated intensively.

## Recycle Bigdata and EPR(Extended producer responsibility)

<img width="300" alt="ranking" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87767242/161151267-16ecbbe9-0d13-47d1-b715-2e89e8e950d1.jpg">

After collecting various data such as waste manufacturers, locations, and numbers, I want to apply EPR to manufacturers. A certain amount of recycling obligations are granted to manufacturers to recycle, and if they fail to comply with this, the producer is charged a recycling charge above the cost required for recycling.

## Various profile decorations

<p align="center">
<img width="200" alt="ranking" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87767242/161201288-221bb6c8-baf6-409c-ae84-b9604a552a32.gif">

</p>
It's a little boring to just use points for donations. If we collect points, we will buy something that allows us to decorate our profiles with special effects that move our profiles, and show off our decorated profiles in the community. This will allow people to collect more points.

## Trash can location

Picking up trash isn't the end of it. Since it has to be handled properly, users can check the location of the trash can during plogging, and other users can see the location of the trash can displayed.
